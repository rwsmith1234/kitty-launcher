# Licensing

## Origin

Kitty Launcher is a fork of [Couchy Launcher](https://github.com/conreo/couchy-launcher), an open-source Android TV launcher. Kitty retains the original project's GPLv3 licensing and builds upon its codebase.


## The app

**Kitty Launcher is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3).**
The full text is in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

In short:

- You are free to **use, study, share and modify** Kitty.
- It comes with **no warranty**.
- **Copyleft:** if you distribute a modified version (a fork, a rebuild, a different-name build), you must release your source under the **GPLv3** too, and grant the same freedoms. There are no proprietary forks — improvements flow back to everyone.

## Bundled third-party components

These keep their own licenses, all compatible with GPLv3:

## Content that is *not* distributed

The built-in **aerial wallpapers** stream video owned by **Apple, Amazon** and
community creators. Kitty ships only a manifest of public URLs, never the
footage itself, and streams it only when you enable that wallpaper. The
decorative video is fetched over a TLS client scoped to that purpose; no
credentials or personal data are ever sent.

## Contributions

By submitting a contribution you agree to license it under the GPLv3, the same
terms as the rest of the project.
